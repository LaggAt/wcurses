This repository contains a partial implementation of the Python curses module 
for Windows.

It originally began back in 1998, for Python 1.4, if you can believe it. Since 
then it has had about two brief periods of activity, surrounded by years of
indifference and neglect.

Patches are much appreciated, for bugs, missing features and tests.

To compile this project you will need Visual Studio 2008 and Python 2.5.
